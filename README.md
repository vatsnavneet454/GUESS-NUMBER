# GUESS-NUMBER
🎮 Project Showcase | Number Guessing Game (Web Application)

I’m excited to share my latest project – a web-based Number Guessing Game built using C++ (CGI) for backend logic and HTML & CSS for frontend design.

🔹 Number range: 1–100

🔹 10 attempts with smart hints (Too High / Too Low)

🔹 Previous guesses tracking

🔹 Continuous gameplay

🔹 Gaming-themed UI

🔹 Apache server (CGI)

This project helped me understand server-side programming, CGI, and state management using file handling.
